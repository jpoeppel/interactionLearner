\chapter{Conclusion \label{chap:conclusion}}


%Discuss pro's and cons of concepts/realisations
%What are the reasons for good/poor results?
%What are the limitations of the ideas/realisations?
%How much do the ideas/realisations solve the initially stated problems?
%How do these results/ideas relate to other previous work?
%What could be possible improvements?

\begin{itemize}
	\item Discuss evaluation results
	\item Compare models (model configurations) with each other
	\item Compare to related work where possible (especially with \cite{pushing})
	\item Discuss if goals are met, or to what extend they are met
	\item Discuss model limitations (i.e. what will it never be able to do) (consider including possible extensions/solutions directly with the limitations))
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Extrapolation to unseen interactions
		\item Reliance on \enquote{velocity} ?
		\item Interaction vector required
		\item Current representation does not account for local differences in the world (only relative features are considered, the absolute position in the world is not taken into account)
	\end{itemize}
