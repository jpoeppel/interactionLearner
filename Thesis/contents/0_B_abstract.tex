\chapter*{\enskip Abstract}

The classical machine learning approach is to train suitable models on reasonable big data sets before deployment. However, this approach is not suitable in many scenarios such as robotics due to scarcity of data. Furthermore, general purpose robots are expected to be able to deal with unknown circumstances. This requires the ability to incrementally adapt to unknown situations.

This thesis considers learning about simply object manipulations such as pushing as a simplified scenario of adapting to unknown environments.
Within this context, this thesis suggests and discusses two memory-based concepts that challenge the tasks of incremental online learning with limited domain knowledge.
The concepts learn forward and inverse models of their environment, allowing them to predict future states as well as incrementally reach desired target states.

The learned forward and inverse models of the environment's dynamics are evaluated separately in different scenarios.
The evaluations show that the proposed methods both successfully learn to predict future states and interact with their given environment while providing insight of remaining problems.
