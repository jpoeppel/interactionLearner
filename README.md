# masterThesis

Repository I used to manage all files related to my master thesis. Included are the source codes of for the actual project, the required gazebo worlds and plugins as well as the actual thesis. Furthermore, the slides for the presentation are included.

To be able to build the plugins:
```
export masterPath=[path_to_master]
```
To be able to load the plugins:
```
export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=${GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH}:[path_to_masterThesis]/gazeboPlugins/build
```
